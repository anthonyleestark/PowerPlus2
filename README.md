# Power++ v2.0 STL (2017)
Based on PowerClick v1.0, a small utility developed by myself since Jun-2015.  
Originally, it only allowed setting up corresponding actions for left/right mouse buttons.  
Version v2.0 added several advanced features and was officially renamed as Power++.  
The original source code of the first version has been lost because I didn't back it up when upgrading version =)))

## Changes and updates
### Version: 2.0 (v2.0.1.0) - Release Date: August 2017

**Improvements and corrections:**

- Fixed a bug that software crashed when pressed [Apply] button continuously
- Fixed a bug that software unexpectedly reopened sometimes after exitting

## Build & usage
- This version's source code has been deprecated and is for archival purposes only
- I do not recommend building and running this version, use [Power++ v3.x](https://github.com/anthonyleestark/PowerPlus3) instead
